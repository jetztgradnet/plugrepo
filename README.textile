h1. Plugrepo

h2. About

Plugrepo is an offline Grails (and maybe Griffon) plugin repository. It can be used as a offline proxy for the grails.org repository as well as a repository for internal plugins, which are not ment to be published.

h2. Features

* plugins can be uploaded to internal repository
* manual installation of plugins from the upstream repository
* browsing of plugins from internal and upstream repositories
* automatic update of plugin meta data from upstream plugin repositories (e.g. central repository at grails.org)

h2. Work in progress

For the first release, a couple of things still need to be done:

* tests!
* manual installation of plugins from the upstream repository
* automatic, transparent installation of plugins from the parent repository, when using @grails install-plugin@ (proxy mode)


h2. Roadmap

Other ideas:

* blacklisting of plugins and plugin versions
* check whether plugrepo can be used for Griffon
* multiple internal and external (upstream) plugin repositories
* security (allow upload/installation only for authenticated users, etc.)
